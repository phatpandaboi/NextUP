# NextUP - Discover Tomorrow's Sports Stars

**NextUP** is a web application designed to give casual sports fans a more personalized, engaging way to explore rising prospects across minor leagues - starting with the Minor League Baseball. The goal is simple:
**make it easier for fans, and especially everyday fans, to follow emerging talent and give under-the-radar athletes more visibility.**

## Purpose

NextUp aims to:

* Provide casual fans an easy way to learn about prospects
* Centralize player stats, bios, and performance trends
* Highlight players who deserve more recognition
* Offer personalized recommendations based on user interests
